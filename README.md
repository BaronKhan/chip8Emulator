# chip8Emulator
A custom CHIP-8 Emulator for Windows.

## Overview
This is a work-in-progress CHIP-8 Emulator for Windows. The CHIP-8 interpreter was one of the first virtual machines created to run applications and games on any architecture with the chip, and was available on some graphing calculators in the 1990s.

The main purpose of this emulator is to create a custom Chip-8 emulator that can change the game in a certain way (e.g. coloured objects, different sounds) without changing the ROM's binary itself.

## Planned Features
Once the emulator is in a fully-working state (only a few opcodes have been implemented at the time of initial commit) then the following will be planned custom features for the emulator:
* Resolution settings
* Colour mode (based on sprite objects)
* Multiplayer modes for games features score attacks
* Smartphone and 3DS ports
